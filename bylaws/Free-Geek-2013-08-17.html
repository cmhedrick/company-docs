<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="ARTICLE_I._PURPOSE"> ARTICLE I. PURPOSE </span></h2>
<p>a. Free Geek is organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and as the same may hereafter be amended (the "Code"), including the making of distributions directly in support of such purposes or the making of distributions to organizations that qualify as exempt organizations under Section 501(c) (3) of the Code. References to sections of the Code shall be construed to include corresponding sections of any future federal tax code.
</p><p>b. The primary purpose(s) of Free Geek, in furtherance of its charitable and educational purpose, shall be to recycle technology and provide access to computers, the internet, education and job skills in exchange for community service.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="ARTICLE_II._MEMBERSHIP"> ARTICLE II. MEMBERSHIP </span></h2>
<p>Free Geek shall have no members. It shall be governed by a Board of Directors (the "Board").
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="ARTICLE_III._THE_BOARD_OF_DIRECTORS"> ARTICLE III. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_1._Function."> Section 1. Function. </span></h3>
<p>The Board shall provide for the oversight of the business and affairs of Free Geek and shall exercise all the powers of Free Geek as provided by the law and the Articles of Incorporation, but subject to any restrictions imposed by the Act, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws. The Board may by resolution delegate to committees, including an Executive Committee of their own number, or to Officers of Free Geek, such powers and functions as they may designate from time to time.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_2._Number_and_composition."> Section 2. Number and composition. </span></h3>
<p>a. The Board shall consist of at least three (3) Directors. The exact number shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board; provided, however, no decrease in the number of Directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director.
</p><p>b. The Board shall strive for a balanced composition among its membership of issue interests relevant to Free Geek’s mission, interests of Free Geek client groups, and relevant skills. The Board also shall strive for at least 25% of the Directors to be Volunteer Representative Directors. Volunteer Representative Directors shall be selected from active volunteers (as defined by the Board) to represent volunteer interests on the Board.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_3._Term."> Section 3. Term. </span></h3>
<p>a. The term of each member of the Board shall be approximately two (2) years, except that the initial term of any director may be one year or two years, to the end that in each year the terms of as close as possible to one-half of the Directors shall expire. A Director, unless he or she first resigns or is removed, shall hold office for the term for which he or she is elected or until his or her successor is elected and qualified, but the term shall be extended if its expiration would cause the number of directors to fall below the minimum required number of directors.
</p><p>b. There shall be no limit on the number of terms which a Director may serve.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_4._Designation_and_Election_Procedures."> Section 4. Designation and Election Procedures. </span></h3>
<p>a. Prior to the annual meeting of the Board, the Board shall arrange and hold a meeting of Free Geek volunteers, during which announcements will be made about any need for Volunteer Representative Directors in accordance with Section 2.b. above. 
</p><p>b.  Prior to the annual meeting of the Board, the Board shall elect the successors to the Directors whose terms expire that year, other than Volunteer Representative Directors, except that a Director shall not vote or block consensus on that Director’s own position. Nominations shall be sought from the community served by Free Geek, including but not limited to the Board, the Staff, and Volunteers.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_5._Annual_Meeting."> Section 5. Annual Meeting. </span></h3>
<p>The Board shall hold meetings at least once each calendar year, or more often as necessary.  The Board shall, by its own resolution, designate such dates, times and places as it may choose for such meetings; provided, however, the annual meeting of the Board shall be held no later than the last day of October of each calendar year.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_6._Special_Meetings."> Section 6. Special Meetings. </span></h3>
<p>Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chairperson and must be called by the Chairperson upon the written request of at least two Directors.  Notice of a special meeting of the Board shall be delivered in writing or given orally to each Director not less than 10 days prior to the meeting and no more than 60 days prior to the meeting. The notification shall include the date, time, place and agenda of the special meeting.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_7._Waiver_of_Notice."> Section 7. Waiver of Notice. </span></h3>
<p>A Director may at any time waive any notice required by the Act, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. Except as otherwise provided herein, such waiver must be in writing, signed by the Director entitled to notice, specify the meeting for which notice is waived and be filed with the corporate records. A waiver of notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice.  The attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_8._Quorum_and_Voting."> Section 8. Quorum and Voting. </span></h3>
<p>A majority of the Directors in office immediately before the meeting begins shall constitute a quorum at any meeting. Decisions made by such a quorum shall be the act of the Board unless a greater vote is required by the Act, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.  Where the law requires a majority vote of the Directors in office to establish committees to exercise Board functions, to amend the Articles of Incorporation, to sell assets not in the regular course of business, to merge, or to dissolve, or for other matters, such action is taken by that majority as required by law.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Section_9._Presumption_of_Assent."> Section 9. Presumption of Assent. </span></h3>
